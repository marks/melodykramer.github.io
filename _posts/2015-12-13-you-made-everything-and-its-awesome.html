Hello everyone,
<br><br>
Initially I asked people to share their best writing from the year on Twitter. There were <a href="https://twitter.com/mkramer/status/674626721212145664">lots of responses.</a> Then I decided to expand the prompt to include...well, anything...for this newsletter... and I'm glad I did. Over 150 people participated on both Twitter and in the newsletter. Here are some of the things you've made:
<br>
<ul><li>a standing dinner date</li>
<li>a musical instrument</li>
<li>a toast at a wedding</li>
<li>the decision to quit a job</li>
<li>a handmade knit dress</li>
<li> a funeral service</li></ul>


I can't tell you how much I've enjoyed reading all of the responses, both to the tweet and then to the newsletter.
<br><br>

The best thing I made this year was probably this newsletter (and the decision to move to a very, very small town in NC.) I really enjoyed reading your responses and hope you do too. Have a wonderful end of 2015!
<br><br>
- Mel </br>
<br>
<strong>PS:</strong> If you like this, please feel free to pass <a href="http://www.tinyletter.com/melodykramer">the newsletter</a> along to a friend. Or you can send them the link to the web version. 
<br>
<strong>PPS:</strong> Why don't news organizations do something like this with their audiences? (Feel free to borrow this idea. That's the entire point of this newsletter.)
<br>
<strong>PPPS:</strong> Any typos/errant links are my fault and I apologize for them. I handcoded this. (If you know of a better way to do this, please let me know. Gmail is encoded in a weird format, so it's not possible to cut and paste.)

<h2>5-year plan</h2>

	<br>
		<strong>Amy</strong> is proud of <a href="http://blog.amyrenepowell.com/blog/my-work-part-3">this sketched outline</a> of her five-year plan.
	<br>

<h2>About section for Stamp-Related Website</h2>

	<br>
		<strong>David</strong> writes "I contribute webmastering and write some content for a non-profit environmental conservation organization. The web site has been running for a couple of years, but it seemed to me that we were missing a one-page explanation of what the group was all about, with an elevator pitch for a lede. So I wrote <a href="http://www.friendsofthestamp.org/learn/stamp-basics/">Stamp Basics.</a>"
	<br>

<h2>Apps</h2>

	<br>
		<strong>Cassandra</strong> is really proud of <a href="http://www.pbs.org/wgbh/americanexperience/newsandthen/">this American Experience project</a> which uses the Public Media Platform to connect American Experience film clips and relevant current events news.
	<br><br>
		<strong>Julia</strong> made a <a href="https://medium.com/journo-salary-sharer">journo salary sharer.</a> She writes, "I'd never made something so useful to other people before, and it gave me all the warm fuzzies."
	<br><br>
		<strong>Maria</strong> nominates <a href="http://s3.amazonaws.com/uploads.knightlab.com/storymapjs/75f7d49adcc7fc9f8576c585174ec8c8/a-9mm-glocks-travels-in-providence/index.html">this story about a gun with an attached red laser</a>, which was produced by her colleagues. "We thought this story map was the right way to tell this story," she says. She also sends along <a href="https://storify.com/mariacap/on-twitter-strong-reaction-to-raceinri-interviews-">this Storify</a>. "This was a powerful moment for our 2015 public-service project team."
	<br><br>
		<strong>Rob</strong> writes "I helped put together <a href="http://cloud.registerguard.com/brian-babbs-final-hour/">the Web presentation of this story</a> and I'm pretty proud of my coworkers' reporting and the final product. The story deconstructs the confusing police response to a veteran struggling with PTSD. We tried to build a narrative around the text while using 911 audio, police statements and the dash cam footage of an armored vehicle, as well as interviews with others, to assist the reader in understanding what actually happened."
	<br><br>
		<strong>Peter</strong> made an <a href="http://audiosear.ch">audio search engine</a> with his coworkers.

<h2> Asking for help</h2>

	<br>

		<strong>Anonymous</strong> writes "The choice to ask for help and keep going."

<h2>Bedroom in an apartment shared with a roommate</h2>

	<br>
		<strong>Kylee</strong> says the best thing she made this year is "the bedroom in the apartment I share with a roommate in Los Angeles."

	<br><br>
		"It is the best thing I made this year because it's the end result of a series of difficult, scary, and important decisions. The idea of this bedroom was a meditative, escapist coping mechanism I developed during this time.
	<br><br>
		In the Fall of 2014, I made the decision to leave an emotionally abusive spouse.
	<br><br>
		This was not a bolt in the night decision because I'm overly loyal and self-doubting. It took a few months before I built up the courage and resources to walk. Many of those weeks were spent coming to terms with the idea of being a divorced person, which made me feel bad about myself. I needed time to sort out my feelings and grieve my failures before I could focus on taking action, and I also needed time to figure out logistics.
	<br><br>
		During that time, I retreated to the idea of my formerly non-existent bedroom: in a beautiful apartment, in a city I always wanted to live in, 1300 miles from where I currently lived. I searched #cozybedrooms on tumblr. I looked at IKEA and bookmarked beds. I'm not particularly interested in interior design. I prefer to live simply, purging many of my belongings in my move. But the bedroom, my bedroom, was a sand garden. It symbolized a place that would be my own -- something I never had in my twenties -- but most of all, it represented a safe space.
	<br><br>
		I really needed a safe space. 
	<br><br>
		In the spring, I did what needed to be done and moved out. I spent a couple months "homeless" in a city where I knew practically no one, living in motels and carting around everything I owned in my car. I was productive and did good work. I slept in my car the night before flying to a conference where I spoke on gender diversity. Nobody knew what was happening because I kept it all closed up tight.
	<br><br>
		A few months after I made the cross-country drive, I had steady enough work to stop sleeping on the floor or mercifully in a spare bed. Taking my bedroom from a coping mechanism to a tangible thing was the release I needed. I assembled the first thing that was truly my own since I was a teenager and I allowed myself every emotion I wanted to feel while I did it. 
	<br><br>
		Now I've been here six months and I'm doing really well. The lived-in feeling of my bedroom -- the crumpled clothes and unmade bed -- make it seem like this was never just a thought that helped me get through the day. It makes the bad stuff seem so much farther away.
	<br><br>
		That's why my bedroom is the best thing I made all year."
	<br><br>

<h2>Books</h2>

	<br>
		<strong>Mickey</strong> writes <a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/mickeylin/baby-sherlock-the-crumbs-of-baskerville">a children's book</a> called Baby Sherlock: The Crumbs of Baskerville.
	<br><br>
		<strong>Miri</strong> published a photo book titled <a href="http://www.miriberlinphotography.com/books/">Berlin Mirimalism.</a>
	<br><br>
		<strong>Bennett</strong> made <a href="http://www.soundcurrent.info/">a book about listening meditation</a> and a <a href="http://wera.fm/">whole new radio station</a>, too.

<h2>Bot</h2>

	<br>
		<strong>Chrissy</strong> made <a href="https://twitter.com/findnickisverse">a Nicki Minaj Twitter bot.</a> "You @-mention it with the title of a song Nicki Minaj is featured on and it will reply with a YouTube link timestamped to when her verse starts (you can also @-mention with the word "shuffle" and get a random Nicki verse!)," she writes. "Very soon it will be a free-standing website, but the bot was a fun first step. [It was] built with Python and Tweepy."
	<br><br>
		<strong>Sara</strong> made <a href="http://digital.vpr.net/post/sewage-overflow-vt-weve-got-bot#stream/0">a sewage bot</a> for Vermont Public Radio. <a href="https://github.com/vprnet/bots/tree/master/sewage-bot">(code)</a> "â€‹It's lovingly referred to around here as the poop bot. It sends <a href="https://twitter.com/dirtywatervt">automated tweets</a> when there's an update to the State of Vermont's database of reported sewage outages. The original idea was to show the severity of spill through a range of 1 to 5 poop emojis, but the newsroom nixed that very quickly. Now it just tweets date/time, location, and number of gallons estimated."
	<br>


<h2>Career Changes</h2>

	<br>
		<strong>Maria</strong> writes, "I've been working for 20 years. This past July I left my job with the notion of working for myself. That's what I've been doing since. It's all things one can imagine and more. Challenging, scary, and thrilling.  But so right in so many ways. I gather inspiration from lots of places and folks.  And I have to say you are not a small measure of that inspiration.  Here's to a great new year for everyone."
	<br><br>

		<strong>Caitie</strong> writes "I left my job as a Senior Foreign Policy Advisor in Congress to make <a href="http://thelightningnotes.com/about/">The Lightning Notes</a>, a short daily post to help us move the world forward. It features <a href="http://thelightningnotes.com/2015/08/04/how-to-overwhelm-the-world/">great ideas</a> and <a href="http://thelightningnotes.com/2015/10/19/the-antidote-to-shame/">striking stories</a> to remind us that we matter and improving the world is our matter."

	<br>

<h2>Charts</h2>

<strong>Laura</strong> made this chart showing which episode of a show gets viewers hooked:

</center>

<br>

<h2> Chemistry-Related Comic Book </h2>

	<br>
		<strong>Veronica</strong> says "I think the best thing I made this year was a kickstarted <a href="http://www.veronicaberns.com/atomicsizematters/">comic book version of my PhD thesis.</a> That is, it's a comic book that contains all of the same information as a doctoral dissertation on theoretical solid state chemistry, but it is written so that anyone can understand it."
	<br>

<h2>Children</h2>

	<br>
		<strong>Matthew</strong> writes, "We made a foster child a son!"
	<br><br>
		<strong>John</strong> writes: <br>

		"Big websites at work<br>
		But wife did 5 pounds more.<br>
		Family = 3."<br>
	<br>


<h2>Code Club</h2>

	<br>
		<strong>Jonathan</strong> started a coding club at my high school. (<a href="https://github.com/railsclub/meeting-notes">Curriculum on GitHub.</a>) He was able to get ~10 kids interested in web development with Ruby and Ruby on Rails. "It's neat because my school's computer science classes only cover Java :(," he says. "It's also neat because a lot of the kids said they preferred Ruby's dynamic typing to Java's static typing."
	<br>

<h2>Collection of front pages after the Supreme Court ruling on same-sex marriage</h2>

	<br>
		<strong>Kristen</strong> gathered <a href="http://www.poynter.org/news/mediawire/353539/front-pages-from-all-50-states-on-the-same-sex-marriage-ruling/">a collection of front pages from every state following the Supreme Court's ruling on same-sex marriage.</a> "I got up that morning and thought I'd take a look for any that stood out," she says. "But they all stood out. I think it was our most read piece from this year."
	<br>

<h2> Collaborative Blogging Experiment</h2>

	<br>
		<strong>Stephen</strong> participated in a "one-year experiment in <a href="http://cele.sog.unc.edu/">joint blogging on community engagement.<a>"
	<br><br>
		<strong>Andy</strong> made a blog with Melanie Cooper, who he met through one of this newsletter's previous experiments. (The one where everyone got a random penpal and was asked to share their passion with a stranger.) "After we started chatting back and forth, we decided to collaborate on <a href="http://randomlymatched.blogspot.com/"> a blog called Randomly Matched</a>, which really opened my eyes to the justice and prison system, especially how it works (or more accurately doesn't) work for women," he writes. "Not only that, but Melanie is a delightful person to know, and I'm a better person all around for it."
	<br>

<h2>Computer Science Video</h2>

	<br>
		<strong>Jared</strong> writes "the best thing I made this year is a series of surreal, yet educational, videos covering the basics of computer science. It's a collaborative project with my younger brother, JR. Here's a link to the first video, <a href="https://youtu.be/bJKltx0MFmI">What is Computer Science?"</a> But my absolute favorite in the series is <a href="https://youtu.be/_fSrOYzClL0">"Powers of 2"</a>, in which we constructed Daft Punk-inspired Arduino-powered robot puppets and used "Around the World" to illustrate exponentiation"

<h2> Cool Websites</h2>

	<br>
		<strong>Cassie</strong> writes "The best thing I (tried) to make was <a href="dollaraday.co">Dollar a Day</a>, a platform for micro-gifting to charity on a daily basis. We hand-picked the charities, everybody signed up to automatically give $1/day. It was a part-time experiment, built on mostly volunteer hours, definitely a labor of love, and we ran it on the side for a full year before we decided to wrap up. We open-sourced the code and posted some thoughts on lessons learned, though, in the hopes that another team of folks will take up the mantle and continue to innovate on the idea. <br><br>

		Objectively, I am sure some people would say Dollar a Day was a "failure." (It never got higher than 1,200 donors.) However, I reflect on it as a scrappy experiment where I learned tons, connected meaningfully with my small team and community, and (at the very least) seeded the idea of something into the world that could go onto be impactful."
		<br>


<h2>Data Visualization</h2>

	<br>
		<strong>Michelle</strong> made a <a href="https://rossieronline.usc.edu/science-of-classroom-design-infographic">a data visualization</a> of academic research that highlights how physical elements of K-12 classrooms impact student learning.
	<br><br>
		<strong>Dave</strong> created <a href="http://wvpublic.org/post/data-viz-when-did-west-virginias-heroin-problem-begin-which-counties-are-hurting-most">this data visualization</a> to show which counties in West Virginia are hurting most from the heroin epidemic.
	<br>

<h2>Decision to use a daily planner</h2>

	<br>
		<strong>Sarah</strong> writes that the best thing she made this year was her daily planner. "I reviewed a bunch of bullet journal formats and came up with one for a dotted Moleskine that makes the most sense for me, while being flexible enough to adapt to whatever I need it for next.  It keeps me organized and has become my book of record!"
	<br>

<h2>Designs and Drawings</h2>
	
	<br>
		<strong>Lisa</strong> drew a set of 13 friendly monsters to be used on Memory Game cards.
	<br><br>
		<strong>Molly</strong> says the best thing she made was a design that she made that reminds her to "make many things." She writes,"It's been a helpful reminder to constantly be churning stuff out and sharing it with the world, even if it's in rough/early stages â€” and every once in while something unexpectedly amazing comes out of it!"
	<br><br>
		<strong>Mike</strong> is really proud of <a href="https://dribbble.com/shots/2166961-Logo-PHL-Design-Co">this logo</a> he made for PHL Design Co.

<h2>Email Aggregator for city of Minneapolis</h2>

	<br>
		<strong>Anton</strong> made a system that aggregates emails from the city of Minneapolis. He writes "My city government (I'm in Minneapolis) has over 100 email separate listservs for updates from various departments, but has no central place where all these updates are kept, so you can't see them all in one place. This was kinda frustrating, especially for a government transparency advocate like myself. I didn't want to have my inbox flooded with updates but I did want to have a chance to look at all the updates at a glance once a week or so just to see what's going on.
	<br><br>
		So my hacker solution was to create a new email account which subscribes to all the listservs, then post the emails to a wordpress site, then tweet out a link to the post. The site isn't very polished, but it's useful enough for me (and about 40 Twitter followers!) It's <a href="https://twitter.com/mplsannounce">@MplsAnnounce</a> on Twitter if you want to check it out."

	<br>

Her dad and I have been friends since we dated during our senior year of high school, when he was a foreign exchange student from Sweden. Thirty-one years is a long time, over thousands of miles, through many life events, so I suppose that the friendship he and I forged in 1984 might be one of the best things I (and he) made that year."

		<strong>Rachel</strong> writes "The best thing to come out of me this year was laughter. And that wonderful feeling of joy :) I know, not a "thing" that was made as one would make a quilt or something of that nature, but I think things can be overrated sometimes."
	<br>

<h2>Life Coach Service</h2>

	<br>
		<strong>Alex</strong> writes "The best thing I made this year was <a href="https://www.themuse.com/coaching">Coach Connect</a>, along with my incredible team here at The Muse. It was a very new type of product for us, and one that we built incredibly quickly. I'm proud of how we listened to user demand, tested and validated the product and pricing (very quickly but without sacrificing the rigor of our testing), and then designed and shipped the MVP while juggling other company needs."

<h2>Personas</h2>

	<br>
		<strong>Bridgett</strong> writes, "I work for a marketing agency for nonprofits. This year, we developed audience personas for Make-A-Wish, and I lead a project that turned those audience personas into print materials - like flip books, cards, and posters - that are now in Make-A-Wish chapter offices across the country helping them tell more audience-focused stories. It was a very cool, rewarding <a href="blog.see3.com/how-make-a-wish-is-telling-new-stories-with-audience-personas/">project.</a>"
	<br>

<h2> Photo</h2>

	<br>
		<strong>Dan</strong> writes "I made a lot of things this year, but oddly, I'm hesitant to say that <a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/scarndp/17311521261/in/album-72157649933334773/">I "made" this</a> as I happened to be in a place at a certain time. I saw the picture before it happened, to be sure, but it was pure happenstance that it played out as it did. Nevertheless, the craft of creating a journalistic/street type photo is anticipating a moment which tells a story and capturing that moment.
	<br><br>
		In April, when the Supreme Court agreed to hear oral arguments in Obergefell v Hodges, this little drama played out. An older conservative white man lecturing a gay black man on how he should live his life seemed to define so much of where we are as a country right at that moment.
	<br><br>
		My friend Arthur, a gay black man, immediately bought a print to give to his mother for her birthday. That a friend found so much meaning in it means more than anything else."
	<br><br>
		<strong>Marissa</strong> began a <a href="http://www.marissagawel.com/american-attraction/">photo series to document roadside attractions and their creators.</a><br><br>
		<strong>Josh</strong> writes "I took this photo of a musician who was on the show backstage after a sound check. His name is Malcolm Holcombe, and he kind of presents as a wild man. But his music is intricate and tender. So unexpected. I didn't pose him. I pointed my camera at him and he just sort of gave me a piece of himself. (That's my favorite thing about portraiture) And when he was done, he was done. Thankfully I was prepared well enough so that everything was technically correct in the camera on the first click."

"It began as a one-off episode of the main Incomparable podcast, but listeners demanded more," he says. "So we did a Christmas special that was twice as long. That was in 2013. Demand kept buildingâ€”we did a couple of live shows, then began building the podcast network. Once there was a network of shows, listeners started asking for a spinoff Radio Theater series. I wrote the first season through this year, we've been recording like crazy, and here's the first half of the first season of shows. Right now, we're on a break with a supersized Christmas special on the way, then coming back in January to finish out the first season. And I'm already writing the second season. It is the most fun I've had as a writer, bar noneâ€”and I usually have fun writing..."

<h2>Poetry</h2>

	<br>
		<strong>Sam</strong> shares this poem:
	<br><br>
		In Which I Am Unable To Accept That The Statement "Everyone Who Is Friendly To Me Must Know Something I Don't" Might In This Case Not Be True
	<br><br>
		i am talking to someone who voluntarily moved to los angeles<br>
		and then voluntarily moved away from los angeles<br>
		so:<br>
		i am talking to someone who thinks they know something<br>
		they don't<br><br>

		instead of not understanding, they say,<br>
		they are not standing under their umbrella when it rains<br>
		they are holding their umbrella upside down<br>
		they are drinking its water<br>
		they are understanding<br><br>

		so<br>
		i have to say:<br>
		i can't understand it,<br><br>

		but i never drank water that way before.

Connected to that was diving into creative pursuits for the first time in a long time (reading, creative writing, actively listening to music, surrounding myself with creative and create-ing people). Also connected to that, getting my tattoo. :)"

<h2> Standing Dinner Date</h2>

	<br>
		<strong>Mica</strong> says she made a standing weekly dinner date with her 13 year old daughter. And kept it. Every week. "We meet for an early dinner-no siblings or anyone else," she says. "She chooses what we talk about. I'm just there for her. Then at 5:45 she heads to orchestra rehearsal and I head home until it's time to pick her up 2 1/2 hours later. It's an investment that has paid me back in spades."
