I worked in a rare books library during college. People came into the library to pour over documents. Most of the time, they were writing a paper or an autobiography and needed primary documents to piece together someone's life. 

How could we write one of those now, without relying on any correspondence whatsoever? How could you could track me for an entire day?

Let's start with the easiest and work our way up.

1. Where have I been? (Google Location History) (Instagram Location Endpoint) (Foursquare Location Endpoint) (WAZE) (Photos from the Department of Homeland Security) (E-Z Pass Data) 

2. What was I reading? (Pocket history) (Chrome history) (Instapaper history) (Kindle history)

3. What event(s) did I attend? (Eventbrite history) (Ticketmaster database)

4. What were my thoughts on X? (social media)

5. Was I hot or cold? Was at home or at the office? (Nest data) (Hue data)

6. Did I purchase anything? (Credit card data) (Square data) (Amazon history)

7. When was I likely commuting? (Twitter data - when was I not posting, correlated with Metro data)

8. Was I where I said I was? (Instagram EXIF Location endpoint data - related: [this AP story](www.washingtonpost.com/politics/lawmaker-with-lavish-decor-billed-private-planes-concerts/2015/02/23/c7754d72-bbac-11e4-bdfa-b8e8f594e6ee_story.html)) 

9. Was I on a job interview or giving a speech? (Twitter data: did lots of people from the same company follow me at once?) (Did I have an Out of Office message up?)


What am I missing?
