1. Find someone who doesn't work in your field of work, study, or interest.
2. Ask them to think about an idea you have, related to your field of work, study, or interest.
3. See if your idea changes based on what they say.

This can be done in person, on the phone, on the internet, at a lunch table, or on social media. You don't have to report back.

Have a good weekend.
