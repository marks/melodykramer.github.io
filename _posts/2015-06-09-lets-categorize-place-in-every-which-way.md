**Not sure where to place these:**

GPS

Geopolitic (historic and current: the relationship between former colonies/colonizers affects their news distribution; areas with high immigrant populations report different kinds of news, eg I'm currently in Germany, where news about the Turkish elections broke several hours before I received a NYT alert about it)

Languages

Social Feed



**Other thoughts:**

You might browse the  [Getty Geographical thesaurus](http://www.getty.edu/vow/TGNHierarchy?find=&place=&nation=&english=Y&subjectid=7029392) for more ideas: Also, you might narrow even further to "corner" or "surface" and then to "body" since every body (HUR HUR) is unique.
