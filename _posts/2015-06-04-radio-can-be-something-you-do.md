[Machiko](https://twitter.com/machikoyasuda) sends along [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xS92XkVKM0Q), which her parents watch on YouTube every morning. She says:
My favorite thing about Japanese public radio / public television is their short, 2-5 minute exercise shows every morning. It's the same routine every day! For decades! (The [history of radio calisthenics](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radio_calisthenics).)

Radio/TV can be something you *do*, not just listen to or watch.
I love this idea. It made me think in new ways. You?
