title: About
---

I [currently work on a variety of projects](https://18f.gsa.gov/team/melody/) at [18F](https://18f.gsa.gov/), a digital design and technology agency within the U.S. government. I also write [a weekly column](http://www.poynter.org/author/melody-kramer/) for the Poynter Institute and lead [Media Public](http://www.mediapublic.io), a public media startup that's funded through a Knight Prototype Grant.

I was a 2014-2015 Visiting Nieman Fellow at Harvard University, where I [wrote a report](http://www.niemanlab.org/2015/07/putting-the-public-into-public-media-membership/) on how public media could better serve its audience by broadening the definition of membership.

Previously, I worked at NPR, where I led product teams and managed products that helped NPR better understand its existing audience or reach entirely new ones. I worked firmly at the intersection of our editorial and product teams, and led the development of products that reached millions of listeners and online users.

Previously, I launched and then managed digital at Fresh Air with Terry Gross and worked as an editor and writer at National Geographic Magazine. Prior to that, I wrote for, produced, edited, and directed Wait Wait Don't Tell Me, NPR's humor show. I started my career on a Kroc Fellowship, a full-year paid reporting fellowship at NPR that's given to three early-career journalists each year.

I'm from Philadelphia, but currently live in Carrboro, NC with my wife and our dog Sadie. We enjoy hiking, exploring small towns, cooking, and watching trashy TV.
