### The Media Public: Mel's Nieman Fellowship Sprint One

## The Backstory

Last August, I gave a speech about public media membership. If you want to read the entire speech, [it's here](https://medium.com/@mkramer/what-does-it-mean-to-be-a-member-of-a-public-media-station-and-what-could-it-mean-59b0d3c90204) or you can watch the [five minute ignite version here](www.youtube.com/watch?v=gZVI18RLbyk), but the thesis was this:

>What does it mean to be a member of a public radio station in the United States? What could it mean? How could expanding the definition of membership instill a sense of ownership and identity among listeners, allowing them to feel more connected and invested in public media's content, work and mission?

I am spending the next eight weeks embedded at Harvard University on a [Visiting Nieman Fellowship](https://medium.com/thelist/my-nieman-application-essay-59663a303d5b) examining those questions. By the end, I hope to develop....something. I'm not sure what that something is yet. 

## Why not?

I'm a little scared of this fellowship. It gives me eight weeks of time, and to tell you the truth, I'm not sure of the best way to spend this time. What would have the most impact? What, if anything, should I build? How should I measure what works and what doesn't work? Where does Harvard fit into all of this and how can it help facilitate this project? I don't know yet.

I have eight weeks. That's a lot of time but also not a lot of time. I don't want to overpromise and underdeliver. I don't know what I don't know. 

My working hypothesis is taken from the speech: that **expanding the definition of membership — to include people who can donate a skill, code, or their time — will inculcate a sense of ownership and identity among listeners, allowing them to feel more connected and invested in public media's content, work and mission.**

It's a perfectly fine hypothesis - but it's just a hypothesis right now. 

## That's where you come in. Please. Come in.

I'd like to treat this fellowship as a series of four two-week-long-sprints where we think about membership and community together. I really like opening up a process because it's more transparent and accountable, and leads to everyone feeling more invested in the outcome.

I see myself taking on the role of facilitator or project manager. 

In each sprint, I will publish some background reading and some goals and my thoughts on a plan for achieving those goals, and then ask for your feedback to refine the sprint. Over the course of the two weeks, maybe I'll:

* talk to people you recommend 
* examine or build tools 
* look at case studies
* do research
* make a rapid prototype
* code something
* do user testing
* design something
* attend a lecture or presentation that's related
* write something that we can look at together. 
* measure something

Every morning, I'll update you on [my website](http://melodykramer.github.io/) - and we can shift goals accordingly.

At the end of every two week period, I will summarize and publish everything we learn during the sprint, and where that may lead us for the next sprint. I suspect what we learn will be applicable to more than just public media - this is something libraries, museums, newspapers, financial institutions, airlines, public health professionals, educators, universities, federal agencies, local governments, civic tech groups, musicians, and anyone who makes anything that needs an audience might find interesting. 

## Okay, that all sounds nice, Mel - but what do YOU hope to get out of this?

1) I want to help build something that helps public media. I think it's a vitally important resource that we have in the United States and I deeply believe in the mission.

2) I love building projects in public like this. So I'm hoping this is successful. But if it's not - you'll know - and we'll learn something too.

3) I hope this project continues beyond the fellowship. Documenting and documenting well will be key in moving it forward.

## Are you getting any money out of this?

Nope. I get a tiny fellowship stipend, which is less than my salary - and I took a two-month leave of absence from my job to do this, so I'm going to be returning to my college diet of beans and oatmeal for two months. If you know of any free meals on the Harvard campus, let me know. 

## What do you have planned for the first sprint?

A lot. I'm calling this the Media Public Planning Sprint. We will:

1) Articulate what the project is, what the goals are, how it will be structured.

2) Write up everything I've learned so far and everything we've read / all of the research that might be helpful.

3) Make list of people to talk to 

	3a) Answer all of the email related to this project
	
4) Make list of case studies to develop from other industries (libraries, universities, museums, beverage conglomerates)

5) Determine whether a playbook is meaningful, and if so, what it should contain

6) Exercise every day to stay sane. 

7) Do user research with 6 stations (2 large, 2 medium, 2 small) on membership and resource allocation

8) Investigate whether forking something like [Govcode](https://www.govcode.org/) would be meaningful

9) Investigate whether forking something like [Midas](https://github.com/18F/midas) would be meaningful


## How can I give you feedback on this? 

1) If you're familiar with GitHub, fork this page and add your thoughts.

2) Tweet at me. I'm @mkramer

3) Email me. I'm melodykramer@gmail.com

4) Come to my twice weekly open office hours. TBD, but likely a Google Hangout.

## El fin

How cool is this? We're going to make something awesome together. I love this! I have been looking forward to this for the past eight months and am excited to dig in and get started.
