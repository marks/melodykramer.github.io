I don't think I've ever had a job where the description matched up exactly with what I actually did. That's actually great, because I think of a job description as kind of a canvas. So what if a job description:


1) contained a sample week-in-the-life of the job
2) explained what you would learn in the first month, six months, and year
3) was written by the people who previously had the job
4) was a  [gantt chart](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gantt_chart)
5) was considered to be a living document, which changed routinely as your role within your workplace changed
6) included salary range and everything you need to know about flexibility
7) included why the position was created or where the person who formerly had the job is.
