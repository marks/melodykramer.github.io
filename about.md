  Hello! I'm Mel. I design and then build tools and/or strategies that help organizations reach new audiences or think about audiences in different ways. I mostly work on projects that help make stuff more accessible and transparent. I code, write, edit, do user research, develop strategies, manage products and projects, design - basically whatever is needed to get the job done. I love what I do, and love sharing what I learn along the way.

I [currently work on a variety of projects](https://18f.gsa.gov/team/melody/) at [18F](https://18f.gsa.gov/), a digital design and technology agency within the U.S. government. I also write [a weekly column](http://www.poynter.org/author/melody-kramer/) for the Poynter Institute and lead [Media Public](http://www.mediapublic.io), a public media startup that's funded through a Knight Prototype Grant.

I was a 2014-2015 Visiting Nieman Fellow at Harvard University, where I [wrote a report](http://www.niemanlab.org/2015/07/putting-the-public-into-public-media-membership/) on how public media could better serve its audience by broadening the definition of membership.

Previously, I worked at NPR, where I led product teams and managed products that helped NPR better understand its existing audience or reach entirely new ones. I worked firmly at the intersection of our editorial and product teams and led the development of products involving breaking news, analytics, archives, social media and long-term editorial strategies. I also managed NPR's engagement strategy across all social networks, and gave weekly tours to members of the public.

Previously, I launched and then managed digital at Fresh Air with Terry Gross and worked as an editor and writer at National Geographic Magazine. Prior to that, I wrote for, produced, edited, and directed Wait Wait Don't Tell Me, NPR's humor show. I started my career on a Kroc Fellowship, a full-year paid reporting fellowship at NPR that's given each year to three early-career journalists. In college, I wrote an award-winning humor column, worked as a writing tutor and in the rare books library, and ran the campus humor magazine.

I'm from Philadelphia, but currently live in Carrboro, NC with my wife and our dog Sadie. We enjoy hiking, exploring small towns, cooking, and watching trashy TV. We are hoping to expand our tiny family soon.
